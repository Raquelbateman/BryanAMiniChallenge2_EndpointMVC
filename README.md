// Mini Challenge 2-4 Endpoints MVC

// Brief Description: Design an API endpoint that receives user input and outputs a personalized greeting, such as "Hello, {user's name}."

// Peer Reviewed By: Julius
  Working great! Like the use of the variable "statement" on the last endpoint for storing the saved strings and outputting them together with the "\n" for spacing. The code is formatted neatly and easy to read.
