// Mini Challenge 2-4 Endpoints MVC

// Brief Description: 

1. Endpoint that accepts 2 numbers.  Once you have the numbers, add them together and print out the results in a sentence.

2. Endpoint that accepts 2 inputs. You will take the answer from those inputs and display the answer in one sentence.

3. Endpoint that accepts 2 numbers. Results should print the following 2 statements:
     I. The first statement should tell me if the first number is greater than, less than or equal to the second number.
     II. The second statement should tell me if the second number is greater than, less than, or equal to the first number.

  Working great! Like the use of the variable "statement" on the last endpoint for storing the saved strings and outputting them together with the "\n" for spacing. The code is formatted neatly and easy to read.
